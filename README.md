# UFOs

### Overview of Project

>##### Purpose:
>The purpose for this project was to create a webpage that users could view and interact with to view all the different UFO sightings through out the world. We were provided a 'data.js' document that held all the different UFO sightings with different details about each one such as the date of the sighting, the city, state, and country where the sighting happened, the shape and duration of the sighting, and any comments about it. I used the 'data.js' file to create a dynamic and interactive table where the user can filter the data by date, city, state, country, and/or shape.

### Results

>##### How to Use:
>Here is the top of the webpage; it has a title and a little article that also has a title, then under that is where the filter search criteria is and next to that is the table with all of the UFO sightings.

>This image shows the bottom half of the webpage before any search criteria is entered.

>This image shows how the user can just search for one item such as searching for all the sightings in Ohio, this resulted in 3 sightings.

>Then this image show how the user can search for multiple items such as all sightings that happened on 1/1/2010, in the city of el cajon, which is in the state of ca, in the country of the us (there is probably just one city named el cajon so the user would not need to enter in the state and country as well but they could to make sure it was the correct information), and also all sightings that looked like a triangle. Once we entered this search two results came up as seen in the image below.

>The user can enter 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 filters.

### Summary

>##### Drawbacks of the design:
>One drawback to the webpage design is that the user would have to know that they can't capitalize any words, abbreviations, or names in the search criteria, they have to spell everything correctly, and the date has to have '/' in order for the search filter to return any results. 

>##### Two Recommendations:
>one recommendation for this webpage would be to include some kind of drop down menu in each of the search criteria that allows the user to choose which one they want to search instead of relying on them to enter all information correctly on their own. 
>A second recommendation for this webpage would be to maybe include a data scraping button and we could possible get our data on sightings for other websites that our constantly updated and this way the user could scrape for new data before picking their search criteria and they would always get the most updated information available.
